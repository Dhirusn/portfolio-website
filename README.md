## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** (Ideally the latest LTS version - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn** ([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/))
* **Angular CLI:** Install globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli` or `yarn global add @angular/cli`.

### Development server

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```
    (Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]` and `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]` with your repository details)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    # or
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Use the Angular CLI to generate new components, directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
ng generate directive directive-name
ng generate pipe pipe-name
ng generate service service-name
ng generate class class-name
ng generate guard guard-name
ng generate interface interface-name
ng generate enum enum-name
ng generate module module-name
```

## Building the Project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

## Running Tests

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/). This will open a browser window with the test results.

### Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities (e.g., [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/)). Follow the setup instructions for your chosen E2E testing framework.

## Deployment

Instructions on how to deploy your portfolio website will depend on your chosen hosting provider. Some popular options include:

* **Netlify:** [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)
* **Vercel:** [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)
* **GitHub Pages:** [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)
* **Firebase Hosting:** [https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting)

Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for specific deployment steps. Typically, you'll build your project using `ng build --prod` and then deploy the contents of the `dist/` folder.
